# iOS Installation

How to install MediathekViewMobile on iOS devices.

## Background

MediathekViewMobile will not be allowed in Apple's App store due to its restrictive policies.
However, I believe that everyone should be able to install any software they like on their own devices.
Apple's App store can be bypassed using the [Alt Store](https://altstore.io/) - an alternative App store.
No jailbreak required.

## Prerequisites

- Your personal Apple ID
- A Mac or Windows computer

## How to

First, download Alt Server to your computer from [here](https://altstore.io/).

Use the `AltServer` to install the `AltStore` App on your device.
Please see [here](https://altstore.io/faq/) how to do it (only couple steps).

Then, download the [MediathekViewMobile application from Github](https://github.com/mediathekview/MediathekViewMobile/releases) to your device.
The name is `MediathekViewMobileApp.ipa`.

Use the `files` app on your device to find and open the downloaded file.
This should automatically open the AltStore application.
Alternatively, open the AltStore application and navigate From to the `My Apps` tab.
Tap the "+" button in the top left, then select `MediathekViewMobileApp.ipa`.

Reauthenticate with your AppleID if requested.
The `AltStore` will now install `MediathekViewMobile` on your device.

## Important

From the [AltStore FAQ](https://altstore.io/faq/)

_Apps that have been installed using non-developer Apple IDs 
(in other words, Apple IDs not tied to a $99/year Apple developer account) 
are only valid for 7 days, at which point they will no longer open. 
To compensate for this, AltStore will periodically attempt to refresh your 
apps in the background, and you can always manually refresh your apps from within AltStore._

This means that you should at least once a week turn on your computer and have `AltServer` running to 
keep using `MediathekViewMobile` after 7 days.

But don't worry if it is expired already, `MediathekViewMobile` can always be enabled again at a later point in time.
You will also NOT loose access to your downloaded videos - they can still be found in the `MediathekView` folder on the device.
